# Named Entity Recognition For Task Execution of Audio Commands

We take user input and identify a potential command to execute. The possible commands
are reminders, alarm and schedule. The layman’s term would be a virtual personal
assistant like Siri or Alexa. For the purposes of this project, the application does not
access external applications such as google maps to execute commands e.g. give
directions on google maps ;the project focuses more on the recognition task by use of
verb noun phrases and outputting of data formatted based on its entity id’s for analysis
and as potential bootstrapping data. The program takes users audio input and outputs
the task(s) and the entity(ies) it recognized. We have some task execution such as setting
reminders or taking notes currently go to a formatted textfile.
